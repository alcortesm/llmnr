                                                              version 03

1. Introduction
---------------

This guide shows how to pass some tests to the llmnr application. It’s
based upon the one the teachers used for the 2008 February exam. 

The tests proposed here are not exhaustive or unequivocal, but they are
good examples of what is expect from your application. Note that the
lab assignment is the official reference in case of doubt.

The automatic assessment will be based on these tests, but will be more
exhaustive. This is not a collection of tests vectors; it’s just a
complement to the lab assignment. An application that passes these
tests can fail on the automatic assessment and vice versa, but it will
be unusual.

If you found error son this document, please send a patch as soon as
possible to:

    Alberto Cortés <alcortes@it.uc3m.es>

Modifications to this file will be broadcasted to your student email
accounts.

2. How to use this guide
------------------------

All invocations shown here are for the ‘bash’ shell, note that ‘bash’
is not the default shell for most of the student accounts.

You will need to launch text terminals in three different hosts. You
will be using those terminals to launch llmnr senders and receivers
with different configuration files, so you will also need the
configuration files.

The hosts to run these test are:

 monitor01.lab.it.uc3m.es 163.117.144.241
 monitor02.lab.it.uc3m.es 163.117.144.242
 monitor03.lab.it.uc3m.es 163.117.144.140

The configuration files are:

 http://it.uc3m.es/alcortes/asignaturas/iro2/1.conf
 http://it.uc3m.es/alcortes/asignaturas/iro2/2.conf
 http://it.uc3m.es/alcortes/asignaturas/iro2/3.conf

Each group will be using a different port to prevent interfering with
the other student’s applications. Declare an environment variable
called 'port’ and set it to your group number plus 5000. Example: group
nine will type:

    ; export port=5009

On each of its terminals.

To clearly show on which host are we running each invocation we have
change the prompt of the terminals to something sort and useful: '1; '
for monitor01, '2; ' for monitor02 and '3; ' for monitor03.

    alcortes@monitor01# export PS1='1; '
    1; 

    alcortes@monitor02# export PS1='2; '
    2; 

    alcortes@monitor03# export PS1='3; '
    3; 

Example: The students of group nine could change the default bash
settings to have all the above this for free adding the following
lines to ‘~/.bashrc’:

    # iro2 test stuff
    if [ `hostname` == 'monitor01' ]
    then
        export PS1='1; ';
    elif [ `hostname` == 'monitor02' ]
    then
        export PS1='2; ';
    elif [ `hostname` == 'monitor03' ]
    then
        export PS1='3; ';
    else
        export PS1='\h; ';
    fi
    export port=5009



3. Tests and their results
--------------------------

(Test 01) A query

    1; llmnr -p $port -r 1.conf

    2; llmnr host1.uc3m.es
    #[2008-04-01 17:01:34+01:00] query sent [id: 0x0f12]
    #[2008-04-01 17:01:34+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 0x0f12]
    host1.uc3m.es.  50      IN A        163.117.144.241
    2; echo $?
    0



(Test 02) A and CNAME query

    2; llmnr -p ${port} www.uc3m.es CNAME
    #[2008-04-01 17:03:02+01:00] query sent [id: 0x23fa]
    #[2008-04-01 17:03:02+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 0x23fa]
    www.uc3m.es.    86400   IN CNAME    host1.uc3m.es.

    2; llmnr -p ${port} www.uc3m.es A
    #[2008-04-01 17:06:43+01:00] query sent [id: 0x4d4a]
    #[2008-04-01 17:06:43+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 4d4a]
    www.uc3m.es.    86400   IN CNAME    host1.uc3m.es.
    host1.uc3m.es.  50      IN A        163.117.144.241




(Test 03) Interactive mode query and local query

    3; llmnr -p ${port} -i -r 3.conf
    llmnr> host1.uc3m.es MX
    #[2008-04-01 17:12:24+01:00] query sent [id: 0x3e78]
    #[2008-04-01 17:12:24+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 0x3e78]
    host1.uc3m.es.  86400   IN MX       1 smtp1.uc3m.es.
    host1.uc3m.es.  86400   IN MX       2 smtp2.uc3m.es.
    host1.uc3m.es.  86400   IN MX       3 smtp3.uc3m.es.

    2; llmnr -p ${port} host3.uc3m.es SOA
    #[2008-04-01 17:15:20+01:00] query sent [id: 0x05a2]
    #[2008-04-01 17:15:20+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.140 [id: 0x05a2]
    host3.uc3m.es.  86400   IN SOA      ns1.uc3m.es. root.uc3m.es 200510011 28800 7200 604800 86400

After that, back in terminal 3...

    llmnr> host3.uc3m.es A
    host3.uc3m.es.  50      IN  A       163.117.144.140

This last query is local to terminal 3. You can resolve it using local
communication between the sender and its local responder or using a
multicast query as usual.


(Test 04) PTR query with two active responders

    2; llmnr -p ${port} 140.144.117.163.in-addr.arpa PTR
    #[2008-04-01 17:22:12+01:00] query sent [id: 0x4f22]
    #[2008-04-01 17:22:12+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.140 [id: 0x4f22]
    140.144.117.163.in-addr.arpa. 50 PTR host3.uc3m.es.
    2; llmnr -p ${port} 163.117.144.241 PTR
    #[2008-04-01 17:24:18+01:00] query sent [id: 0x367a]
    #[2008-04-01 17:24:18+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 0x367a]
    241.144.117.163.in-addr.arpa. 50 PTR host1.uc3m.es.




(Test 05) Retransmissions

    2; llmnr -p ${port} uc3m.es SOA
    #[2008-04-01 17:32:05+01:00] query sent [id: 0x2813]
    #[2008-04-01 17:32:06+01:00] query sent [id: 0x27b2]
    #[2008-04-01 17:32:07+01:00] query sent [id: 0x11f6]
    2; echo $?
    1



(Test 06) RFC compliantness

    2; sudo tcpdump -s0 port ${port} -w /tmp/captura-${port}
    <introducir contraseña>
    <C-z>
    2; bg
    2; llmnr -p ${port} host1.uc3m.es SOA
    #[2008-04-01 17:37:10+01:00] query sent [id: 0x422c]
    #[2008-04-01 17:37:10+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 0x422c]
    host1.uc3m.es. 86400 IN SOA ns1.uc3m.es. root.uc3m.es 200510011 28800 7200 604800 86400
    2; fg
    <C-c>
    2; ethereal /tmp/captura-${port}


Use wireshark to show if you are sending bad llmnr payloads. Note:
responses must carry the query.


(Test 07) Big payload

    2; llmnr -p ${port} -r 2.conf

On terminal 3, still on Interactive mode...

    llmnr> host2.uc3m.es MX
    #[2008-04-01 17:41:12+01:00] query sent [id: 0xafd2]
    #[2008-04-01 17:41:12+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.141.242 [id: 0xafd2]
    #[2008-04-01 17:41:12+01:00] query sent [id: 0x2d17]
    #[2008-04-01 17:41:12+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.141.242 [id: 0x2d17]
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 1 mx1.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 2 mx2.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 3 mx3.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 4 mx4.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 5 mx5.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 6 mx6.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 7 mx7.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 8 mx8.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 9 mx9.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 10 mx10.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 11 mx11.uc3m.es
    host2.uc3m.es 86400 IN MX 12 mx12.uc3m.es
    ...

And so forth until 500.

The second query must be a TCP query




(Test 08) Uniqueness

Kill the responder on terminal 2.

    2; llmnr -p ${port} -i -r 1.conf
    #[2008-04-01 17:55:00+01:00] resource record RR conflict with 163.117.144.241

There should be as much traces as RR in conflict.

To known if the conflict has been resolved...

    llmnr> host1.uc3m.es
    #[2008-04-01 17:57:05+01:00] query sent [id: 0x32ad]".
    #[2008-04-01 17:57:05+01:00] answer received from: 163.117.144.241 [id: 0x32ad]".
    host1.uc3m.es       86400   IN A        163.117.144.241
