should virtual destructors be public?

read http://parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/coding-standards.html#faq-27.10 (lint-like rules) and apply

rdataCNAME, rdataSOA, rdataPTR






make unmarshalling an inherited method of rdata

change name from marshalling and unmarshalling to marshall and unmarshall

make an operator== for rdata (read book or web before, it can be difficult!)
make unmarshalling for rdataMX and rdataNS
