rr needs a good explanation, mention exceptions of parser

there is a need for args-test...

should virtual destructors be public?

read http://parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/coding-standards.html#faq-27.10 (lint-like rules) and apply

rdataCNAME, rdataSOA, rdataPTR



change marshall/unmarshall of rdataNS to use dnsname2buf and buf2dnsname
make marshall/unmarshall for rdataMX
